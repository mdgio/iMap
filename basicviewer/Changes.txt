	** "earth1" --darker browns, like chocolates
	** "earth2" --lighter browns, like mustards
	** "black" --simililar to "imap" but darker
* Query tool improvements:
	** Better phrasing to instruct user on how to enter a value for a selected field

7/3/2014
* CSS corrections to allow for color changes to Home Button and recently added tools when themes are changed.  (Themes:  imap, gray, blue, green, purple, orange)
* Placement adjustments to Search and Zoom to County tools to allow better map viewing on smaller form factor screens.
* Adjustment in Table of Contents (_TOCNode.js) to correct anomalies between map symbology and Table of Contents symbology.  ("tempArray[j].url == rends[i].url" now using label, "tempArray[j].label == rends[i].label")
* Changed zoom extents for the ZoomToCounty tool.  Some counties were zooming within their boundaries. 
* Changed a parameter in Query to "like" instead of "=" to give more leeway for a choice in select by attribute query.
* Adjusted a configuration setting that corrects a tab choice when configuring the template via ArcGIS Online.  If you wanted to use and select the Query tab but not the Add Data tab, you would have gotten both anyway.
